My name is Sam Li, and I am a software engineer specializing in Windows security research. My primary focus is on reverse engineering and kernel-related development, where I enjoy delving deep into the intricacies of the Windows operating system to understand its inner workings and enhance system performance.

In addition to my professional expertise, I have a variety of hobbies that keep me engaged outside of work. I enjoy exploring new technologies, participating in coding challenges, and contributing to open-source projects. I also have a passion for cybersecurity, which complements my work in reverse engineering.

I believe that continuous learning is essential in the ever-evolving tech landscape, and I strive to stay updated with the latest advancements in software development and system architecture. I'm excited to connect with like-minded individuals and share knowledge and experiences in this fascinating field.
