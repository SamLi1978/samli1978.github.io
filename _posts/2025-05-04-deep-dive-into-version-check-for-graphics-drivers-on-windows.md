title: Deep Dive into Version Check for Graphics Drivers on Windows

Sometimes, we experience a graphics driver failure (Code 31) that indicates the device is not working properly when being loaded after we replace the old kernel binary named amdkmdag.sys with a newly rebuilt one for step debugging on the targeted Windows, if we forget to import the registry setting below into the system simultaneously.



Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\GraphicsDrivers]
"DisableVersionMismatchCheck"=dword:00000001

How come? Let's deeply dive into it. As we know, dxgkrnl.sys plays as the fundamental infrastructure for DirectX graphics kernel subsystem. It's responsible for loading and running display miniport drivers, e.g. AMD graphics drivers.



There's an exported symbol function named DpiFdoValidateKmdAndPnpVersionMatch in the dxgkrnl module, which is called from dxgkrnl!DpiFdoInitializeFdo().

Actually, the function DpiFdoValidateKmdAndPnpVersionMatch() will be called after amdkmdag!DriverEntry() and amdkmdag!AtiAddDevice().

When disassembling the function dxgkrnl!DpiFdoInitializeFdo(), we can see there's a string named 'DisableVersionMismatchCheck' involved in this call, which has the same name as we import the workaround to the system at the beginning of this article.

In the function DpiFdoValidateKmdAndPnpVersionMatch(), dxgkrnl module compares the  PNP version, which is grabbed from the related INF file, with the kernel binary file version. That's called version check. If they don't match each other, dxgkrnl will break into the debugger if it's present, and outputs the string ''A mismatch between the PNP/INF version and the KMD file version on the graphics adapter has been detected. The adapter will fail to start." Furthermore, the function call returns a NTSTATUS error 0xc0000182, which is explained as "The I/O device is configured incorrectly or the configuration parameters to the driver are incorrect." It corroborates the device status report when the registry key DisableVersionMismatchCheck is absent from the system.

That's the way this function works. If we don't want to import the registry key DisableVersionMismatchCheck, but we still would like the rebuilt binary works as we expected, the only path is to sync the file version of the amdkmdag.sys to the PNP version, before getting the binary signed by Osibuild.

We can leverage the DDR tool to collect the correct PNP version from the system. As we see, the current version is 31.0.12012.4006.

The file version of kernel binary amdkmdag.sys can be altered by any third party resource editor, e.g. RisohEditor, which is able to be found at https://github.com/katahiromz/RisohEditor

Originally, we can see the file version that RisoEditor reads from the binary, which is produced by MS C/C++ compiler.

After aligning the file version to the PNP version and recompiling, we finally get a revised binary file,  same as the way the WHQL or NonWHQL building works.

Eventually, the kernel binary amdkmdag.sys works without the registry key DisableVersionMismatchCheck as we expected.
